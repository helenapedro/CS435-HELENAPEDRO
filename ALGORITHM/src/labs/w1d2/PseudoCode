Q1: Third largest — Algorithm 1 (three passes)
    Idea:
        1st pass → find max
        2nd pass → find largest ≤ max (allowing equality)
        3rd pass → find largest ≤ 2nd (allowing equality)

function thirdLargest(A):
    max1 = A[0]
    for x in A:
        if x > max1:
            max1 = x

    max2 = -∞
    for x in A:
        if x > max2 and x <= max1:
            max2 = x

    max3 = -∞
    for x in A:
        if x > max3 and x <= max2:
            max3 = x
    return max3
