Question 2. Carry out the array-based version of HeapSort on the input array [1, 5, 2, 11, 12, 2, 3]. 
You need to first build the heap bottom up. You need not show all the steps. 

final Max-Heap final: [12, 11, 3, 1, 5, 2, 2]
Representation (levels):
          12
        /    \
      11      3
     /  \    / \
    1   5   2   2
Ordered final result:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12]
